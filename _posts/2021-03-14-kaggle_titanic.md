I started Kaggle Study alone.

I will write most of my writing in English to become familiar with English 

The first competition is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster'</a>, It's very famous competition.

The kernel I'm currently studying is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/eda-to-prediction-dietanic">'EDA To Prediction(DieTanic)'</a>.
